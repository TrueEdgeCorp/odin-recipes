This project will be about creating a dummy website for recipes and ensuring that all paths and links work the way it should.

By finishing this project, this will demonstrate my skills in learning HTML fundamentals as well as understanding working in unision
with the command line and Git.

CSS has been implemented to give a more organized and stylized feel to these html pages. RECIPES has been updated to
