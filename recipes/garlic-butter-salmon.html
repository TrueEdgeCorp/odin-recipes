        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Garlic Butter Salmon might look like a simple recipe, but it’s got clout. Salmon is basted continuously with bubbling garlic butter so it seeps 
           into every crack and crevice. A cheffy technique that’s actually dead simple yet produces a luxurious result – you’ll feel (and look) 
           like a pro!</p>
        
        <p>I was a bit hesitant to share this recipe, thinking, “Salmon cooked in garlic butter? So obvious. So simple,” But as I thought about it, I realised 
            that I did actually have some things to say about this “simple” recipe. I'm happy to share with you how I make this delicious dish.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p><li><strong>Salmon Fillets</strong>: Opt for skinless, if you can. More exposed flesh means more garlic butter will seep into the meat! But if 
               you’ve only got skin-on, it’s really not a big deal and I’ve included directions in the recipe.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Because I think I mentioned this is a garlic butter salmon? Finely chop the garlic using a knife and don’t use a 
                garlic crusher because the garlic will burn too quickly otherwise. Also garlic crushers force the garlic juice out, causing it to spit 
                everywhere when it hits the hot butter.</li></p>
            
            <p><li><strong>Butter</strong>: 99% of the time when cooking, I use unsalted butter. For this recipe though, I used salted because I happened 
                to have it. Conveniently, salted butter here partially takes care of the seasoning for you. If you only have unsalted, just add a pinch of 
                salt into the butter.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Lemon</strong>: Just a little squeeze towards the end, for the tiniest tang to balance the richness of the butter. It’s not intended 
                to be a lemon butter sauce like this one. Most people wouldn’t even identify lemon in this!</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Parsley</strong>: For some color as a garnish.</li></p>
