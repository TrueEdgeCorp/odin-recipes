        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Garlic Butter Salmon might look like a simple recipe, but it’s got clout. Salmon is basted continuously with bubbling garlic butter so it seeps 
           into every crack and crevice. A cheffy technique that’s actually dead simple yet produces a luxurious result – you’ll feel (and look) 
           like a pro!</p>
        
        <p>I was a bit hesitant to share this recipe, thinking, “Salmon cooked in garlic butter? So obvious. So simple,” But as I thought about it, I realised 
            that I did actually have some things to say about this “simple” recipe. I'm happy to share with you how I make this delicious dish.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p><li><strong>Salmon Fillets</strong>: Opt for skinless, if you can. More exposed flesh means more garlic butter will seep into the meat! But if 
               you’ve only got skin-on, it’s really not a big deal and I’ve included directions in the recipe.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Because I think I mentioned this is a garlic butter salmon? Finely chop the garlic using a knife and don’t use a 
                garlic crusher because the garlic will burn too quickly otherwise. Also garlic crushers force the garlic juice out, causing it to spit 
                everywhere when it hits the hot butter.</li></p>
            
            <p><li><strong>Butter</strong>: 99% of the time when cooking, I use unsalted butter. For this recipe though, I used salted because I happened 
                to have it. Conveniently, salted butter here partially takes care of the seasoning for you. If you only have unsalted, just add a pinch of 
                salt into the butter.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Lemon</strong>: Just a little squeeze towards the end, for the tiniest tang to balance the richness of the butter. It’s not intended 
                to be a lemon butter sauce like this one. Most people wouldn’t even identify lemon in this!</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Parsley</strong>: For some color as a garnish.</li></p>
        </ul>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <p><li><strong>Season salmon</strong> with salt and pepper.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Sear</strong> the curved presentation side of the salmon (ie. put it in upside down) and cook for 3 minutes until it is nicely 
                golden.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Butter and garlic</strong>: Turn the salmon, cook another minute, then add the butter. As soon as the butter melts, add the garlic; 
                then</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Baste, baste, baste</strong>: Immediately after you’ve added the garlic and even before it has had a chance to go golden, start 
                basting. To do this, tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools on one side. Then scoop up the butter using a large spoon and spoon it over the 
                salmon. The garlic will cook as you baste so by the time the salmon is done, the garlic is perfectly golden.</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Baste 1 1/2 minutes</strong>: Baste for 1 1/2 minutes in total, which should be a total cooking time of around 3 minutes for the 
                second side (1 minute cooking after turning + 30 seconds butter melting time + 1 1/2 minutes basting). Target an internal temperature of 
                50°C/122°F for medium-rare (optimum juiciness), with the thermometer inserted into the middle of the thickest part of the salmon. See below 
                for more information on the internal temperature of cooked salmon; and</li></p>

            <p><li><strong>Rest 3 minutes</strong>, then serve with the garlic butter in the pan!</li></p>
        </ol>
